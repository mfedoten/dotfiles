## Installation

### Git
Obviously, we will need [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Terminal
I prefer iTerm2 over default OSX Terminal.app. The script `install.sh` installs iTerm into `/Applications/Utilities` folder if it is not there yet.

## Other programs I have installed
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)
